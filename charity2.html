		<p class="important" >"The Salvation Army is an integral part of the Christian Church, although distinctive in government and practice. The Army’s doctrine follows the mainstream of Christian belief and its articles of faith emphasise God’s saving purposes. Its objects are the advancement of the Christian religion… of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole."</p>
	
	<h1 class="important">A little information:</h1>
		<ul>

			<li><h1>Our History</h1>The Salvation Army began in 1865 when William Booth, a London minister, gave up the comfort of his pulpit and decided to take his message into the streets where it would reach the poor, the homeless, the hungry and the destitute.</li>

			<li><h1>Religion</h1>The Salvation Army is an evangelical part of the universal Christian Church with its own distinctive governance and practice. Its doctrine follows the mainstream of Christian belief and its articles of faith emphasise God’s saving purposes.</li>
			
			<li><h1>Global Conversation</h1>The Salvation Army brought together more than 200 people from 25-28 March 2014 – in the presence of General Andre Cox – to discuss the way forward for our work 'serving suffering humanity'. This website has enabled many more people to participate.</li>
