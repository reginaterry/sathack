	<h1 class="important">A little information:</h1>
		<ul>

			<li><h1>History</h1>The Task Force for Global Health was founded as the Task Force for Child Survival in 1984. The Task Force was initially tapped to serve as a Secretariat for a consortium of global health organizations: UNICEF, WHO, The Rockefeller Foundation, The United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. These organizations sought Task Force support for a collaborative effort to improve child wellness and survival strategies. With the Task Force as Secretariat for the network, they resolved to work together to develop and implement a plan for global immunization efforts and measures to promote and maintain healthy children and families.</li>

			<li><h1>Organization Overview</h1>Our operating structure is comprised of the primary  non-profit organization, The Task Force for Global Health (the Task Force), and a non-profit subsidiary of the Task Force, Global Health Solutions (GHS). Both the Task Force and GHS are recognized non profit 501 (c) 3 organizations. You can read more about GHS here.  Both the Task Force and GHS are committed to the vision of improving global health.</li>
			
			<li><h1>Values</h1>As we reflect on the accomplishments and events of our first 25 years, we also reaffirm our commitment to working effectively with partners to improve the health and well-being of people in all parts of the world, but especially those most in need and those who have few to advocate for them.</li>
