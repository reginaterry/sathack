		<p class="important" >"We think every child in every country should have a good education. Every citizen should feel financially stable. Every community should be healthy and strong.

We're not alone. Nearly 2.6 million volunteers and 9.6 million donors around the world are with us. Together, we raise more than $5 billion every year to create community solutions that improve life for everyone. Together, we impact the lives of up to 50 million people every year.

United Way is the world’s largest privately-funded nonprofit.  We're engaging people from all walks of life in nearly 1,800 communities across more than 40 countries and territories worldwide. What we do we may look different in Dubuque than in Dubai, but together we're creating real  and lasting change. Our partners include global, national and local businesses, nonprofits, civic and faith organizations, as well as educators, labor, health organizations, government and more.

Our goals are pretty ambitious.  But if you join us, we can do it together."</p>
